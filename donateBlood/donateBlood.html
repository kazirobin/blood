                  The gift of blood can only be given from one person to another,
                  and there is no substitute. So it's nice to know Nepal can rely
                  on everyday heroes' generosity to keep the flow of blood and
                  plasma going.

                  However, the need for blood and plasma is constant, so we're
                  looking for more lifesavers. By putting aside a small part of
                  your day you can make a life-changing difference, you can become
                  a lifesaver too!
