    <p>Introduction
        This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common
        as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them
        do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.
        If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one,
        such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the
        appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks,
        there probably is no application.
        That is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of con
        structing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
        Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally
        tedious and frustrating.
        Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor
        of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, programming can be
        rewarding. It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by
        hand. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do
        before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
        Most programming is done with programming languages. A programming
        language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. It
        is interesting that the most effective way we’ve found to communicate with a
        computer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other.
        Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be
        combined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.
        At one point language-based interfaces, such as the BASIC and DOS prompts
        of the 1980s and 1990s, were the main method of interacting with computers.
        They have largely been replaced with visual interfaces, which are easier to learn
        but offer less freedom. Computer languages are still there, if you know where
        to look. One such language, JavaScript, is built into every modern web browser
        and is thus available on almost every device.
        This book will try to make you familiar enough with this language to do
        useful and amusing things with it.</p>
